    <p>I'm a game developer driven by a belief that games are powerful tools for storytelling, education, and connection. I love the entire process, from the initial spark of an idea and designing mechanics on paper, to the thrill of bringing it all to life through code.</p>
    
    <p>My journey isn't just about solo development. I'm deeply passionate about sharing this knowledge and empowering the next generation of creators.</p>
