    <p>This game was brought to life by the passionate student body of the CRESP program's 2025 cohort. It stands as a testament to their collaborative effort, combining diverse skills in coding, design, and storytelling. The project served as a capstone experience, showcasing the talent and dedication of its creators.</p>
    
    <h3>What problem did I solve?</h3>
    <p>I coordinated a large group of young minds to deliver a capstone project</p>

    <h3>What was my role?</h3>
    <p>I was the lead programmer/project manager</p>

    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <p>I learned how to polish and perfect based on feedback from a live MVP</p>

    <h3>How does it demonstrate my ability to build?</h3>
    <p>This is a fully completed and shipped game that I programmed myself. The ideas were a collaborative effort with the 2025 CRESP student cohort</p>
