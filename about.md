# About Me
I'm a game developer driven by a belief that games are powerful tools for storytelling, education, and connection. I love the entire process, from the initial spark of an idea and designing mechanics on paper, to the thrill of bringing it all to life through code.

My journey isn't just about solo development. I'm deeply passionate about sharing this knowledge and empowering the next generation of creators.
